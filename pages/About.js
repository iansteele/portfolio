          <p>
            I am a principal product designer based in Illinois. Currently, I am
            on the <span className="font-bold">Classroom</span> team at{" "}

              Imagine Learning
            </span>
            . We are focused on providing classrooms across the country with a
            high quality curriculum platform that helps teachers and students
            facilitate learning through planning, teaching, assigning, grading
            and more. I have a sweet-tooth for vector illustration and 3D
            renders.

            <span className="font-bold">teamwork makes the dream work</span>. I
            value teams without egos. Who play to their strengths, work to
            improve their weaknesses, and spread their knowledge with others so
            we can all grow together.

            I am a husband, father of 3, lover of the outdoors, huge fan of all
            things spooky, and a 4-stripe white belt in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. If
            I could only eat ðŸŒ® for the rest of my life, I'd be perfectly ok
            with it.
