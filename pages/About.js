          <p>
            I am a principal product designer based in Illinois. Currently, I am
            on the <span className="font-bold">Classroom</span> team at{" "}
            <span className="font-bold whitespace-nowrap ">
              Imagine Learning
            </span>
            . We are focused on providing classrooms across the country with a
            high quality curriculum platform that helps teachers and students
            facilitate learning through planning, teaching, assigning, grading
            and more. I have a sweet-tooth for vector illustration and 3D
            renders.

            I believe{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">teamwork makes the dream work</span>. I
            value teams without egos. Who play to their strengths, work to
            improve their weaknesses, and spread their knowledge with others so
            we can all grow together.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mt-20">But like... what about NON-work stuff? </h2>I am
          a husband, father of 3, lover of the outdoors, huge fan of all things
          spooky, and a 4-stripe white belt in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. If I could
          only eat ðŸŒ® for the rest of my life, I'd be perfectly ok with it.
