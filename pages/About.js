            I am a principal product designer on the{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">
              Classroom team at Imagine Learning
            </span>
            . Our team focuses on providing classrooms across the country with a
            high quality curriculum platform that helps teachers and students
            facilitate learning through planning, teaching, assigning, grading
            and more. I have a sweet-tooth for vector illustration and 3D
            renders.

          <h2 className="mt-10">But like... what about NOT work stuff? </h2>
          <p>
            I am a husband, father of 3, lover of the outdoors, and a 4-stripe
            white belt in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. I'm a firm believer that Knocked
            Loose, Kendrick, and Brand New will get you through just about
            anything.

            In a nutshell, I am a lifelong learner having fun along the way.
