            Our team sought to understand the classroom environment through
            teacher interviews, analaytics, and fullstory recordings. How have
            classrooms adjusted in a post-pandemic world? We sought to learn
            about what was happening outside of our product and when. How were
            teachers presenting content to students, what tools were they using
            to instruct? How were students sharing their thoughts?

            <li>
              Teachers use a variety of methods to annotate on top of our
              content. This ranged from smartboards, whiteboards, to overhead
              projectors and more.

              To promote classroom participation and classroom management,

              with the teacher.

            We wanted to stress-test what annotating on our lesson cards would
            look like. How would the annotations scale with content? Would they
            fall apart on responsive layouts? What tools are currently available
            in our product that have similar functionality? If there are any,
            can they fit our use case?

            Annotations v.1 was released to teachers for Back to School 2022.
            With the ability to customize card content, we chose to forego
            saving annotations to further promote the "in the moment"
            discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers are able to annotate both in class settings as well as in
            the teacher-led Live Learn experience where teacher-created
            annotations appear on student devices in real-time.

          <p>
            Over the course of 2023, we are monitoring annotation usage via
            FullStory and Mixpanel. We are also keeping an eye out for feedback
            from the customer support team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll be looking to spot unexpected uses and requests of the
            annotation tools. We have a hunch that teachers will want to
            leverage annotations when reviewing student work in order to mark up
            student responses.
