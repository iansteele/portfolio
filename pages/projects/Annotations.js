              Teachers use a variety of methods to annotate on top of our
              content. This ranged from smartboards, whiteboards, to overhead
              projectors and more.

            We wanted to stress-test what annotating on our lesson cards would
            look like. How would the annotations scale with content? Would they
            fall apart on responsive layouts? What tools are currently available
            in our product that have similar functionality? If there are any,
            can they fit our use case?

            We leveraged a third-party annotation tool to get us up and running

            Annotations v.1 was released to teachers for Back to School 2022.
            With the ability to customize card content, we chose to forego
            saving annotations to further promote the "in the moment"
            discussions.

          <p>
            Teachers are able to annotate both in class settings as well as in
            the teacher-led Live Learn feature where Annotations would appear on
            student devices in real-time.
