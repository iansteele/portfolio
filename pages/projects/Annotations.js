            Through customer interviews, fullstory recordings, and feedback from
            customer support, our team sought to understand the classroom
            environment post-COVID. How were they presenting content to
            students, what tools were teachers using to instruct? What tools
            were students using to demonstrate their understanding?

          <ol className="pl-5 space-y-4 list-disc">
            <li>
              Teachers use a variety of methods to annotate on top of our
              content. This ranged from smartboards, whiteboards, to overhead
              projectors and more.

              To promote classroom participation and classroom management,
              students did not have access to devices but instead followed along
              with the teacher.

            We wanted to stress-test what annotating on our lesson cards would
            look like. How would the annotations scale with content? Would they
            fall apart on responsive layouts? What tools are currently available
            in our product that have similar functionality? If there are any,
            can they fit our use case?

            We leveraged a third-party annotation tool to get us up and running

            Annotations v.1 was released to teachers for Back to School 2022.
            With the ability to customize card content, we chose to forego
            saving annotations to further promote the "in the moment"
            discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers are able to annotate both in class settings as well as in
            the teacher-led Live Learn experience where teacher-created
            annotations appear on student devices in real-time.

            Over the course of 2023, we are monitoring annotation usage via
            FullStory and Mixpanel. We are also keeping an eye out for feedback
            from the customer support team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll be looking to spot unexpected uses and requests of the
            annotation tools. We have a hunch that teachers will want to
            leverage annotations when reviewing student work in order to mark up
            student responses.
