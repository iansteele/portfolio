            student need and less time building student-facing materials from
            scratch. In 2021, our digital and print products offered solutions

            Leveraging fullstory recordings, feedback from customer support, and
            customer-interviews, our team built an understanding of the
            classroom set up post COVID, how and when devices are used in the
            classroom. Through affinity mapping we grouped customer feedback.
            After brainstorming potential solutions to these groups, we
            leveraged a Value/Effort matrix to determine what we would deliver.

            <p className="mt-8">
              Teachers were using a variety of methods to annotate on top of our
              content. This ranged from smartboards, to whiteboards, to overhead
              projectors. To promote classroom participation and classroom
              management, students did not have access to devices but instead
              followed along with the teacher.

            We wanted to stress-test what annotating on our lesson cards would
            look like. How would the annotations scale with content? Would they
            fall apart on responsive layouts? What tools are currently available
            in our product that have similar functionality? If there are any,
            can they fit our use case?

            We leveraged a third-party annotation tool to get us up and running
            quickly to test these hypothesis.
