# Welcome to my portfolio

While my primary discipline is design, I really enjoy dev work.

While there are a million different WYSIWYG sites out there, I really wanted to push myself to develop my own site using modern tech. In this case, React + Tailwind.

I sincerely welcome any advice on how I can improve my JS.

Thanks for taking a look!

üçª Cheers,

Ian
